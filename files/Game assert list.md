I'm also new at learning Unity and all I can say is don't buy any courses... There are so many good things for free on YouTube.

Code monkey released an awesome tutorial recently and even expands on it with multi-player.

And my personal favorite Sebastian Graves and the making of Darksouls in unity, however its somewhat advanced but it's awsome as it really feels like you are making a game.

And he just announced that he will make another series for making elden ring in unity.

And don't buy assets from the store untill you have a working prototype that you want to move along with... However keep an eye out on HumbleBundle for packs and assets you might want to buy as the price is really good but make sure the things work with unity since they sell alot of software.
